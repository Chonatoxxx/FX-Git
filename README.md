A collection of Metatrader 4 ["MT4"] and R scripts

### About FX-Git

This project was created by me because projects created by either Software Geeks or Financial Gurus are mutually exclusive.

As both a Software Geek and Financial Guru, I mixed them up by writing codes about finance related stuff.

### What To Do Next

This collection has grown relatively large over time, and some of these scripts are course related.

Eventually, I will be moving some of these course related scripts to separate GitHub repositories.

The core scripts will remain in this repository.

---

### Prerequisites

This collection of scripts was written using either MT4 or R.

- Metatrader 4 ["MT4"] client and demo account with any broker.

- R and RStudio
